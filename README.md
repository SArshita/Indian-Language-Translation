# Indian-Language-Translation
Introduction: 
The BhashaLink Web Application is designed to bridge language barriers by providing instant translations between English and five major Indian languages: Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Kannada, and Telugu. As India is a linguistically diverse country with numerous regional languages, this application aims to facilitate communication, learning, and understanding across different linguistic groups. By leveraging advanced translation technologies, this tool offers an accessible and user-friendly platform for translating text in real time, catering to individuals and organizations alike.
Need / scope of the project: 
In a multilingual society like India, effective communication between speakers of different languages is essential for both personal and professional interactions. This project addresses the need for a convenient and efficient translation tool that supports multiple Indian languages, enhancing accessibility to information and resources. The scope of this project extends to providing a web-based application that can be used for educational purposes, travel, customer service, and more, making it a versatile solution for various translation needs.
Methodology to be used:
1.	Speech Recognition and Translation: Utilizing the speech_recognition library for recording and recognizing speech input, and googletrans for translating text.
2.	Text-to-Speech Conversion: Using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to convert translated text into speech and pygame for playing the generated audio.
3.	User Interface (UI) with Streamlit: Creating a user-friendly interface where users can select source and target languages, input text either through typing or speech, and then translate it accordingly.
Expected outcomes: 
1.	Translation: Users should be able to input text or speech in one of the supported Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Kannada) or English.
2.	Text-to-Speech: After translating the text into the selected target language, the application should output the translated text as speech, allowing users to hear the translated content.
3.	User Interaction: Users can choose between typing text or speaking into the microphone for input, enhancing accessibility and user experience.
